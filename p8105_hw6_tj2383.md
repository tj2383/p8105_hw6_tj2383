### Problem 1

Importing the homicide dataset from the Washington Post.

``` r
homicide_data = read.csv("./data/homicide-data.csv")
```

In this code chunk I create a `city_state` variable by combining the `city` and `state` variables and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. I omitted the cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. I also omitted Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Next I modifiy `victim_race` to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category. Be sure that victim\_age is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data_combined = 
  homicide_data %>% 
  mutate(city_state = paste(city, state, sep = ", ")) %>% 
  select(-city, -state) %>% 
  mutate(case_resolution = disposition == "Closed by arrest")
```
